# Armstrong-Number

- This is a c program in which you can check whether a number is armstrong number or not
- Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example 0, 1, 153, 370, 371 and 407 are the Armstrong numbers.
- 153 = (1*1*1)+(5*5*5)+(3*3*3)  
- where:  
    (1*1*1)=1  
    (5*5*5)=125  
    (3*3*3)=27  
    So:  
    1+125+27=153
